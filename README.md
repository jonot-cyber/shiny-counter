# Shiny Counter
This is a simple counter to keep track of how many encounters/resets
you've done when shiny hunting. Of course, there are other tools that
can do this, such as:

- The calculator app
- Desmos
- Various online counters

However, I had several issues with these options, that I intend on
fixing:

- A lot of tools wouldn't save data when you close it
- It can be hard to hit buttons with small touch targets
- Important information is covered by iOS picture-in-picture mode (I
  have seen my reset count accidentally reset several times when I
  wasn't paying attention and I had to guess at what it was)
- Some of the options would calculate the chance that you would have
  seen the shiny by a certain point. However, they are often hardcoded
  to certain values, which means that they wouldn't be accurate for
  rom hacks like Pok√©mon Blaze Black 2 Redux
